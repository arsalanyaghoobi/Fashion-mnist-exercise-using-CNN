# Fashion-mnist-simple_processing-exercise(No CNN)
This is the image processing task of Coursera(TensorFlow in Practice Specialization by Andrew Ng and Laurence Moroney ), using fashion mnist data-set 
This task got the loss function less than 35 percent;I couldnt get better due to the shortage of the data-set(I think).
Call Back is used inorder to control the loss function and accordingly the expected acc value.
